I made my own Virus Family Chart (and made it very comprehensive); I would fill this up every day for each family for about 15 days before the exams, this strategy was indispensable; Finally, re-listen to the lectures and appreciate Professor Enquist's way of thinking, he assesses things every now and then and forces you to evaluate the importance of pathway X or issue Y.

Some people might never have taken a chemistry course, others might have taken AP chemistry, and then there is anything and everything in between. For this reason, aspects of the course might seem like simple review to some students while other students are struggling to grasp the material. With that being said, if you are interested in chemistry, I would encourage you to take the course! There are many resources available to help you improve your understanding, whether that means going to McGraw, attending weekly review sessions, or taking advantage of office/lab hours. Also, I found it more effective to study in groups than to study by myself. You can learn so much from the people around you, and answering others' questions, as well as asking your own, really helps solidify the material. It can also point you to parts of the textbook that you need to spend more time reviewing. I would also highly encourage you to attend review sessions. They provide you with the opportunity not only to ask questions, but to watch the TAs or professors work through example problems that could be similar to the questions on exams. The lectures are also posted on Blackboard, as are the slides that explain how you should construct your lab reports, and these documents are extremely helpful. As a final comment, if you prepare for the labs, you can often leave quite early. Good luck!", "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in chemistry or have to for engineering. The teachers are great and there is a ton of support from them.

I am not convinced that the practice exams that they told us were from the year before actually were from the year before, because the actual tests were much much harder.", "If you're required to take it for pre-med or BSE, don't worry - you can do well if you pay attention in class and try in lab. Probably not a class you want to take for fun - it's a lot of time for not-very-exciting material.

Wouldn't recommend out of interest ... it's a tough, tough course.", "If you do not have to take this class, do not.", "If you fall behind, try to catch up as soon as you can.", "If you're an incoming freshman that has placed into this course, take it. Even though it's a lot of work and probably much harder than the chemistry you have taken in high school, if you put in the work, you'll do well. Orgo is not as scary as everyone says it is, I promise.", "If you're just taking this for pre-med requirements, brace yourself.", "If you're taking orgo, you are most likely taking it because you don't really have a choice, that being said 830 lecture for me was not as bad as I had thought. Semmelhack is a good lecture, although a little dry. The class is obviously a lot of work (3 midterms), but my preceptors/lab TA's were amazing (Yong Loh and Diana Sun). Hard class, but doable, with lots of opportunities to ask for help", "If you're taking this you must be premed.", "It is very hard work, but there is no doubt that you learn an extraordinary amount. The professors are good, and you can immediately see their immense knowledge on the topics. Preceptors and lab TAs are hit or miss, but the disparity isn't huge.", "It requires a lot of time. Definitely not a class you can cram in one night.", "It's a great course. You learn a lot. Lectures are engaging so definitely go; reading are okay but precept and lab are very helpful to solidify concepts.", "It's a tough course, but you have to get through it for a lot of majors or tracks.  Utilize the office hours and preceptors; they were by far the most helpful aspect.  It's a lot of work and stress,.", "It's doable but not with other huge time-suck courses like COS226. Very time consuming, since you have a midterm practically every 2-3 weeks and a lab report between those periods. Make sure to reach out for help often, study with people, and go to lectures -- even if you're falling asleep at 8:30 AM, having at least some minor exposure to the material will be beneficial when you're looking back at your notes before the exam.", "It's not as bad as what people make it to be. The number of exams and the amount of work that you need to put into the class are overwhelming, but I think this is one of the class where the number of hours you put into studying actually pays off. Do all the practice exams!!", "It's not impossible to do well in orgo, but it requires a LOT of time and effort. Do all of the practice exams you have access to before the midterms/final, because the gap in difficulty between the problem sets and the exams is really big. Staying on top of the material week to week is a must, because it is really hard to catch up if you fall behind initially and the entire course builds on itself.", "Keep on top of material. If you get behind, you'll be lost until the week before when you start cramming for the test.", "Keep up with all the material, it is easy to fall behind; and get a really good understanding of early material, since new concepts build off of old ones. Go to the various review sessions offered for exams, and give yourself plenty of time to do practice exams before the actual exam.", "Lectures are only important to know what is going on in precept.  Buy the little study guide book by David Klein and try to get into Michael Nech's precept he is amazing.", "Make sure that you ask questions early on - the course builds on itself - so if you are uneasy about something early on make sure to get it sorted out, as you will need to understand it well later on!", "Make sure that you go to lectures, and that you start doing practice tests well before each exam.", "Make sure that you keep up on the material. Try to read the book, because it explains the material, and at the very least it familiarizes you with what will be covered in lecture.", "Make sure to take advantage of all the resources that are offered to you.", "Make sure you don't fall behind. This class was so difficult for me. You have no choice but to take it if you need it for your concentration or if your'e a pre med.", "More enjoyable than I expected, seeing as I was taking this as a premed requirement. Exams need a lot of studying for the week before but it's doable to do well. I never found lectures very helpful- maybe that's just my learning style- but the textbook will sometiems clear things up if you're feeling lost. Doing practice problems (psets, practice exams) is by far the most important part of studying and learning the material. Go to precept, do all of the psets and practice exams, multiple times if necessary, and ask questions until you understand things.", "Not as bad as they say.", "Only take it if you LOVE organic chemistry or have to take it.  Honestly, if they keep up the same homework policy, pretty easy and interesting pdf class too.", "Only take this class if you must. It is a very challenging course often difficult to understand. It can get frustrating at times.", "Only take this course if you HAVE to.", "Orgo is actually a pretty interesting course, but it's pretty hard and you need to be prepared to put in a lot of work. But the material is interesting, and the tests are open note so it isn't memorization at all. The psets are optional, but that can make a lot of people not study at all until last minute (would not recommend). Go to the review sessions; the TAs are all pretty helpful. Really the largest struggle is the 8:30 am lecture.", "Orgo is hard, but also one of my favorite classes I've taken. It's not as bad as people make it out to be.", "Orgo is hard. Take it only if you need it for a requirement or if you're really interested in it.", "Orgo is just as bad, if not worse as everyone says. The open book policy as well as the grading policy for exams makes the class bearable.", "Orgo is not as scary as it may seem as long as you get some practice before the exams. Lectures are only helpful if you don't fall asleep. If you do then the readings and other online material are sufficient for studying as well. Aside from resources on campus for this course, there are countless study guides online and Khan Academy that can get you through it.", "Orgo takes up a LOT of time the week before each exam. Make sure you have time in your regular schedule to give up lots of hours to studying orgo, but again just for the week before the exams. Other weeks are relatively light, but I would suggest doing extra practice problems regularly so you really learn the concepts as the course moves instead of waiting until that week before the exam to try and learn everything. Go to office hours with LOTS of questions--the grad students are great. If you don't have questions to ask, you haven't done enough studying, practicing, and thinking through things. There are so many great resources for this course--both on campus and online (online for extra practice problems). Make use of them!", "Pay attention in precept. Reading are not necessary, but Khan Academy might be. Do all the psets and practice exams.", "Practice! Practice! Practice! Highly suggest getting a copy of David Klein's Organic Chemistry as 2nd language.  It is highly worth the investment and provides the tools necessary for problem solving.  The textbook teaches the materials, but this book teaches you the approach for problems.", "Premed student here, this class is very difficult. Get Megan if you can for lab, she's super chill and helpful. If you don't understand the notes, read the textbook and if you don't understand the textbook go online to learn orgo. Also go in for appointments w/ Semmelhack if you don't understand something: he's chill and a friendly guy and will help you out.", "Professor Semmelhack is an excellent and dedicated teacher.  Go to the weekly review sessions he holds, which are very helpful.  Nevertheless, the one person who truly made this class not only survivable but also enjoyable was my preceptor: Michael Nechayev (\"Nech\"). I don't think I've ever met anyone who is as dedicated and effective a teacher, in any subject, as he was.  Nech did so much to help students get through this class.  He made extra practice problems for students, met with students one on one, held multiple review session for exams, and made review sheets.  He gained such a reputation that students from other precepts began going to his office hours/precepts.  He should really get an award for undergraduate teaching.  He deserves it.  Overall, just a really nice, interesting guy too.", "Professor Semmelhack is good, but the exams will kill you. Make sure to do the psets and be prepared to study pretty much the entire semester.", "Seek out the best preceptor and get on their mailing list/go to their precepts. It makes a big difference.", "Significant time requirement, do your best to stay up with the material and practice outside of precept/lecture...if you're thinking about taking it it's most likely because you have to. Good luck! You can do it!", "Solve practice exams.", "Stay on top of the work in the beginning and develop a study schedule. Try to get Nech as your preceptor, he's amazing! Also, McGraw is super helpful if you have questions or don't understand concepts", "Study hard. It's not an easy class and a lot of work. The Organic Chemistry As A Second Language review book is extremely helpful. Also, don't take this class if you don't have to - it's not worth it.", "Super, super well-taught. Orgo is cool!", "Take Sorensen next semester and do what you can to survive first semester orgo.", "Take if you like chemistry or if you have to for a requirement.", "Take it if you need to. If not, you're insane, or a genius and need to get a life either way.", "Take it seriously, just cause P-Sets arent graded doesnt mean you can slack on them", "Take this class only if you have to or are very interested in organic chemistry.  It is extremely challenging and takes a lot of hard work and practice to stay up to par.", "Take this course it is amazing and will change the way you think about chemistry and the world, only if you put in the time and effort.", "Take this course!!!!! Everyone hypes up organic chemistry, but it's incredibly well taught here and super interesting.", "The coarse requires a lot of time to do well in. If you fall behind seek help right away as it can be challenging to catch back up.", "The course is required. I took it as a freshman and it wasn't as difficult as I had anticipated. There is a lot of help and the course is designed to help you do as well as possible. Don't skip lectures or precepts and definitely do past exams.", "There are plenty of resources to help. The preceptors and lab TAs are all very nice and easy to approach. The problem sets aren't graded, so while there isn't stress at getting everything perfect, you get to do the learning at your own pace.  But with midterms coming around so often, you have to be on top!", "This class requires a lot of time. Don't fall too behind or wait to ask someone about confusing topics.", "This course demands a lot of work outside the classroom. Whatever you do, don't give up!", "This course involves teaching yourself. If you do not find lecture helpful, do not go. Use that time to learn and practice the skills on your own and then copy lecture notes from someone who went to lecture.", "This course is extremely well organized and very fair.", "This course is not as difficult as people make it seem. many of the concepts themselves are perfectly simple, and with enough time and attention, anyone can get them. If you want to do well, you will need to put in effort into understanding the material by bothering your preceptors or reading the textbooks. If you can finish a pset, it means youre pretty much solid on the material, so try to do those at least before the exams.", "This course is very difficult, but there is a lot of resources to help you prepare for exams, so do take advantage of those resources, and CHM 305 may actually be kind of fun!", "This is a challenging course and the exams are difficult. However, there are many resources to help you succeed. TRY TO GET A PRECEPT WITH NECH - HE IS GREAT.", "This is a great class!", "This is a very challenging course. Review the notes and do the Psets. Exams are hard", "This is a very demanding class but I learned a lot about organic chemistry.  This class will definitely require a lot of time spent studying outside of class.", "This is a very difficult class and your grade will depend on the amount of effort and work you put. DO NOT take this course as a PDF or if you are not set on premed. ONLY take if you are set on chemistry or mol bio.", "This is a very organized and well-taught course.  Although it's difficult and requires a significant time commitment, it is not as torturous as people often make it out to be.  If you do review on your own and take time to do lots of practice problems and exams, it's definitely possible to be successful.", "This may not be the most exciting course you take, but many people go through it and it's not as scary as people say. Be sure to stay on top of the material, even though the p-sets aren't graded, because it will come back to bite you if you cram for the test.", "This will be your most consuming class, you need to always be in orgo mode--- not an easy class especially with the frequent exams but if you put in the effort your outcomes will be great and you'll feel so accomplished. Stay proactive and you'll be fine!", "Try to take this class different university over the summer if you can. Save yourself the stress and probably at least six months on your life.", "Very challenging course, but if you keep with yours studies, you will be alright. Don't leave the reading and studying for the week before the exam, but study daily/ weekly in small portions. Definitely do all practice exams and read the book, as well as solve all Precept Problem Sets.", "While this course is a requirement for several STEM majors and as well is required for the pre-med student, the course material is interesting, and Professor Semmelhack is a great lecturer. One piece of advice I would give is that the textbook truly is a valuable study aid and resource.", "You can do it, I did it and I'm not that smart. IT is hard but put in the work and you will be fine.", "You need to have a lot of time if you are going to take this course. I would not recommend taking it with challenging courses from other disciplines, especially ones that are time consuming. In order to do well, you need to have hours of free time a week to go over the material and do the readings and finish the problem sets and do practice exams. Also, don't fall behind early because the entire semester builds on what you did in the first unit so if you don't get that you're setting yourself up to struggle.", "You will learn a lot of from Orgo when you dedicate your time to it. There is a lot of material to cover and it will take a lot of time to understand it. The concepts you learn from Orgo will be very helpful as you move on to other Biology and Chemistry courses. \nAdditionally, reviewing lecture notes will be very helpful each week. Lastly, doing all of the practice exams will be helpful as well. Practicing will help you understand the concepts more and be more aware of what's expected of your for an exam.", "You're probably taking this as a requirement, but it's not a bad class. There's a lot of work, but if you keep up with it and don't get overwhelmed, it'll work out.", "You're taking it because you have to. Do the problem sets. Practice.

Just before you do the problem set, go back and supplement your notes  (add parts you missed during lecture) using the slides. Precise graphs will be the most important thing to get down during lecture because much of the content is on the slides.

Not much work, concepts are easy to understand, but the lectures and lab reports can be unclear sometimes.", "Only take this if you are pre-med or (for some reason) a prospective EEB concentrator. Whatever potential the subject matter has to be rewarding is swiftly counteracted by arbitrary grading of somewhat tedious labs, bland textbook readings, and lectures that - while well-organized - consistently exceed what you are expected to know, which, while interesting, presents a burden that the purpose of the class doesn't merit.

Otherwise it will bore you.", "Take your time with the labs and answer them accurately and with specific answers. Pay attention in lecture!", "The class is interesting, but I would only take it if I needed to. The lectures are excellent with a passionate instructor. However, lab report grading is something that most people struggled with.", "The course is harder than it seems. Attend lecture, take good notes, and work hard on the labs!", "The course will be great if you're interested in the subject matter. The material and coursework are not difficult but you might need to ask the professor or your TAs to help you relate labs, written works, or readings to the topics covered in lecture.", "The lab reports are a lot of work and require a lot of thought and they make a large portion of your grade so definitely pay attention to those. The reading are super helpful in answering questions on the exams to provide examples to support your ideas", "The labs are fun. Not losing a lot of points is a little tricky, but if you can get a 5 on AP Bio, you should be fine.", "The lectures are good and interesting but the labs are atrocious. Take it if you're interested in the subject or if you want to get an overview of how our world works from an evolutionary point of view, our environment, and interactions between animals. Think twice and hard about taking it if you need it just to fulfill the distribution requirement.", "The lectures can be a little dry. The labs are relaxing but you need to put some time into the reports. Overall many of the students don't really want to be here. If you have to take it do it. But if you are curious about EEB try to take an ENV or upper level EEB class that is more engaging.", "This class can be very frustrating at times, in terms of not understanding what is expected on lab write-ups and tests, and the instructor giving his opinion in a very definitive but ultimately somewhat unsubstantiated manner.", "This class is a great introduction if you are interested in ecology and evolutionary biology.  I would recommend reading all the assigned readings and always be looking how to connect lecture, labs and readings because you will be tested on all of the above.", "This class is annoying and nitpicky. Be prepared.", "This class is quite interesting, the labs are really good and the most fun of the course.", "This class was a lot more work than I anticipated but was very do able for not science oriented people.", "This class was honestly worse than orgo. You will have absolutely no preparation for the exams, and there is very little guidance in the lab.", "This course is a lot of work in the lab, almost zero in the lecture as long as you take wonderful notes. The breadth of info covered is amazing but also means no particular topic could be considered extremely deeply.", "This course requires a decent amount of time, but it is a good course to take if you are interested in evolution.", "This course was horrible. The material should have been interesting, but instead lectures are boring, lab is completely useless and consists of all busy work and very little explanation of actual concepts, and I felt ill prepared for exams that actually ask you to tie themes together. Lab reports are the worst part of this course- they're not actually lab reports, but a series of short answer style questions that are really vague and often require googling to get an acceptable answer. Plus, you spend all of lab pressing record on a computer or using tape measurers for hours on end, all just to give poor data samples that you are supposed to extrapolate trends from, so there's not much time spent on actually teaching the concepts. Not a difficult class per se, but not an intellectually stimulating or rewarding one at all. Don't take it for fun, because labs are still a big time commitment and a lot of work, and if it's a requirement I'd try to find a different class.", "This has beed the most frustrating of the pre-med requirements. The material is very interesting, but the expectations for grading are not very clear. Weekly lab reports are long and tedious, often to prove very intuitive concepts.", "This is a great intro biology course. Be ready to work a bit especially on the lab reports. Its really important to be able to connect small details to the big picture concepts in order to do well. If you can understand this from the start you should do very well.", "This is an awesome STL for a non-science person I think because it covers so much cool ecology and evolution. Try to really do a good job on lab reports because they will be graded strictly.", "To take notes during class and to always start your lab early and have a study/lab group.", "Unless they fix the lab portion of this class, there are far better science classes at Princeton. The lab reports are not scientific method based, they are essays with incredibly specific and arbitrary answer keys that you don't have and have to try to figure out by pestering you TA with questions. Content is fairly interesting, but more work than it's worth.", "Yeah, as a freshman, this is pretty much what I expected from a college course. Not many surprises. Labs and lectures are interesting.

Good luck.", "This course varies wildly in difficulty and value depending on the instructor.  I personally find the material very interesting.  A good attitude and a drive to learn will make it worth while for you.", "This is easily the worst class I've taken at Princeton, and that's including some real gems such as PHY 104 and COS 402. It's oddly fitting that this class is our CBE capstone course, as it was disorganized, uninspiring, tedious, and all things considered, a general waste of a Princeton education. This class made me feel like I haven't learned anything at all from CBE over the past four years. Professor Kevrekidis is a funny guy and generally means well, but it?s amazing how little he cared about this class, which he communicated to us several times in ?joking? fashion at the beginning of the semester. Lectures: Lectures were highly uninspiring. Professor Kevrekidis did not give a good number of lectures, opting for Dr. Morris or industry lecturers instead, and when he did, he was very difficult to follow. Part of this was because it was very difficult to understand why any of the things that were being taught mattered regarding the course objectives. The learning goals were never communicated to us, so the lectures ended up feeling like a random mix of irrelevant topics, which was very disheartening. I don't think I learned, or at least, retained anything at all from the lectures, despite attending a majority of them. Design Project: The main assignment in this class was a capstone design project using Aspen. The problems with and painfulness of this project (buggy software, outdated tutorials, unclear instructions, programs crashing and work lost, many nights spent in the Design Lab, etc.) are well-documented in past course reviews. What made our project uniquely bad was how many times design specifications were changed over the course of the semester. Just about every week, we would receive an email telling us to change something about reaction kinetics, feed flow rates, acid volumes, and so on that would cause fundamental changes to our process design. Furthermore, the deliverables timeline for this project was very unclear, and when finally released, not strictly followed. Finally, were never given instructions about what to include in our poster or final report beyond an outline of one of the TA's undergraduate design projects, so we ended up winging it and imitating the design projects hanging on the walls. Problem Sets: We were supposed to have five problem sets in this class, but we ended up having only three. The first two were an econ problem set and literally one of our past midterms (from CBE 250), which was absurd to begin with, though at least these were assigned at a normal time at the beginning of the semester. From here on out, we never received a problem set again until the last week of class, which consisted of a random set of HEN and optimization questions that we were expected to do over Winter Break because apparently that would be less painful than doing it during a school week. Solutions to the three problem sets were not posted on BlackBoard until the beginning of finals week. Exams: We were supposed to have a single midterm exam, which was then pushed to December before Winter Break, which then became an in-class final, but of course, one cannot simply schedule an in-class final with the Registrar in December, so it became a 48-hour take-home exam, which then became a 72-hour take-home exam, which was ultimately due after the take-home exam deadline. During this entire ordeal, we were never given clear instructions regarding when the exam would be held, if at all; in fact, towards the end of the semester, many of us believed that the exam would simply not happen at all, given that it was already December and no notice was given, and we had not had a problem set in months, so it was entirely unclear what we would be tested on. Of course, in the last week of class, it was announced that we would have a final exam in January. Even then, we did not learn what would be on the exam until a Review  ...

The preceptors and Dr Smith are great and make the project interesting and enjoyable.

Let me tell you something: math courses are more reasonable than this course. Yes, you read that right. The math department-- notorious for their unreasonable tests and resulting low scores-- is more reasonable and structured than this course.

This is a weed-out class, and the department is actively searching for ways to make sure you have the most frustrating and tiring experience possible. For example, a new, mandatory part was added to the assignment a day before it was due without even sending an e-mail (the assignment specs were simply updated without alerting any of the students). In addition, this class, and the department on the whole, made me really question whether I want to continue majoring in COS.

Exams are generally fair, though the programming exam was a bit of a time crunch.", "INCREDIBLE course overall. Definitely challenging and programming assignments are rather time consuming, but the quality of instruction, amount of resources available, and support that you receive are incomparable to any other course at Princeton. A must if you're considering a job in the tech world - they even have classes that go over interview tips and interview-style questions. Sergiy is a great preceptor, Lumbroso is a great lecturer.

It does a good job of teaching the concepts, although Jeremie Lumbrusio is not a great lecturer.", "If you're looking at this class, it's probably not for fun but rather for a requirement. Obviously, if you need to take this course, take it. If you are coming from 126, just know that you won't be able to get by in this class without watching videos on time. There are online problem sets that test you on the videos, and precepts are more about doing practice problems based around the videos than explaining topics covered in the videos. Programming exams were only implemented recently and may change significantly, but they did seem rather easy. Written exams made up most of the grade and definitely sucked; they were very heavy on order of growth/run time analysis of various algorithms and structures, but these analyses were often near impossible to understand or derive on your own (and you'll probably just memorize them) . But unlike 126, the exams were at least curved in a way. Problems that lots of people did poorly on were thrown out, and grading was very lenient as to give partial credit where possible. Overall, I felt that the class taught too many algorithms, and by the end, I had forgotten what most of them were about.

Start assignments early, watch the lectures, and go to precept!", "It's a step up from 126, but it's got that same, comforting structure of well-organized assignments with a helpful course site.  Lots of neat topics and some tedious ones.  It's a great class to take to figure out if you like COS- in particular the theoretical stuff.  Jeremie has this weird tendency to ask students their grades when they come for help, which can be off-putting if you're struggling, but I think it comes from a genuine desire to give the appropriate advice to each student.", "It's a tough course and lots of work, but it's interesting.", "It's an alright course. I much prefer COS217 over COS226, even though COS217 is a larger time commitment. The assignments in 226 were interesting, but the FOUR exams really made me pressed for time, and I thought that they barely helped me learn the material. Not too bad, but I think that Jeremie has some learning to do before this course becomes better again.", "It's hard.", "Material and online lectures are great!", "Much harder concepts than 126 and more time-consuming.

Make sure you do not tank the exams (actually understand everything on the past exams not just glance at them). They programming assignments are graded more harshly than in 126 they take off major points for incorrect read me's and later on for inefficient / not concise code. Surprisingly, only having 10 drop box submissions was not that bad because they give you other ways to test you code (basically training you to use the command line and stuff instead of depending on drop box ; at most I used 8 submissions and this was a desperate attempt from someone who is not a CS maestro).

Overall, it's a good class but it requires a LOT of time commitment on the assignments and in general.", "The difficulty in this class lies in the amount of time needed to adequately understand all the concepts presented while balancing this with completing the assignments. Allow 10-12 hours to complete each assignment, and start at least four days in advance so you have time to see the lab TAs at a reasonable hour if need be. Understanding the material when it is first presented in each week's lecture is a must - the sheer quantity of exams (4 over the semester) makes advance preparation absolutely necessary so that things are easier the week of the exam. Other than that, you really learn a lot of interesting (and useful) material in this course - just be sure to stay on top of things from the start.", "This class takes up so much time.

You learn how to do so many new things and finish with a final product you can be proud of.", "Take it, but take the project very seriously. Start early, put serious thought into how you organize your work, get user feedback, and don't forget to put effort into making it look professional. The project will always take more time than you think it will!", "Take this class as a COS minor if you want coding experience with friends. If this class is taught by Moretti or Kernighan, you are in luck. Take this class with friends and know probably with whom you want to work for the final project, and start early. Enjoy! (You better be looking this up on princetoncourses.com)!", "Take this class if you have a light schedule otherwise. It is hard, and assignments and the project will CONSUME your life. Also make sure you have a good group early on, otherwise you will be alone and confused.", "Take this class! Doing the project was a lot of fun and I learned more from that than any of my other COS classes here. Definitely helps if you have a good idea and a good team.", "Take this class! Find a good project group early on (experience matters less in my opinion than being able to get along well and have a good time with each other). Find a project you're passionate about, and I would suggest starting on the final project early (i.e. before Spring Break). You will thank yourself at the end of the semester.", "Take this course and start assignments early. Work on the final project as early as possible.", "Take this course! It's quite an experience, and you'll definitely learn many valuable things about teamwork in software development, and general real-life experience for making programming projects happen.", "Take this! Excellent course that teaches more practical material. Get a good group, go in with an idea. Even if you love your group members, there WILL be conflict. Also, don't expect there to be too much support in your app. You must be really self-driven, but use this class as an excuse/to force you to build something you've always wanted to. Also: choose the more difficult project idea. It will be more rewarding at the end.", "The course is definitely worth taking if not for anything else than the chance to finally have some dedicated time to work on a real, substantial project. Choose a project that you're interested in and really want to work on. Lectures aren't very useful, most people just feel bullied into attending them during the second half of the course due to the randomly selected groups that had to present elevator pitches about their project during every lecture.", "The course was enjoyable and I learnt a lot for sure, however, towards the end of the course I was really disappointed by the way we were given feedback on our projects. We received emails with graders' comments, and while no comments that our group received were too derogatory some of my friends received comments that were not constructive in any way, and straight up rude and derogatory. As a student who put in so much effort in not only this class, but all of my classes this semester, I believe that sending out comments and feedback like that shows a complete lack of empathy for the amount of time we have invested in this. I do not know which TAs made these comments but I thought it was extremely unfair for some of my friends to have received the comments and feedback that they did, regardless of what their overall grade was", "The lectures are usually pretty interesting, but really you take this course for the project. Get a good group before enrolling, your project group will make or break you.", "The reviews speak for themselves. Amazing course, amazing professor, amazing guest lecturers", "This class is one of the most hands-on practical COS classes at Princeton. You spend the first half of the semester doing weekly programming assignments, most of which were interesting and force you to work with fairly large codebases. The second half of the semester is dedicated to the course project which can be an incredible learning experience.", "This could be a great course, and if you get a good team it can still be a unique, fun experience. However, the organization and teaching make it so much worse than it could be. I'd say that you could go either way on this one. If you want to experience app or web development, go for it, but don't expect much from lectures.", "This course has incredible reviews, and I definitely learned a lot. That said, I have to offer a word of caution. If you're coming in with no web design experience, you are WOEFULLY underprepared for the final project. It's doable, but it's exhausting. If you are a senior with a thesis thinking of taking this course, DO NOT unless you have to. I suppose it may be the lesser evil in terms of systems courses, but this is basically more independent work added to your thesis. Otherwise, if you don't have a crazy busy semester, it's worthwhile.", "This course is great! Find a group that you enjoy working with and make sure you do something that is interesting. You'll have a lot of fun working on it then.", "This course is much more about breadth than it is about depth. Often times it will feel like you are covering random topics/languages and that you don't know much/anything about, and because of the shallow coverage, you will still feel that way at the end of their coverage. The assignments can feel random, but make sure you put in the time because they're worth a hefty amount of the grade, and there's not many of them. Working on the project is very rewarding, but only if you choose something you ACTUALLY care about. When choosing your team, make sure to have people of different backgrounds and specialties, AND START EARLY. It will make things much easier later on.", "This course is not as great as everyone says it is. The first half is manageable if you start the assignments a reasonable time. The second half is mostly about the project. If you have an idea you really want to develop, you'll have a great time. Lectures in the second half are kind of useless and unorganized. It was worth it because I had a great team, and it was probably less painful than OS.", "This is a course where you learn how to learn new programming languages and tools. I came in with no web development experience and left with a web app that hundreds of Princeton students use every day.", "This is a must-take course if you are a COS major. You will learn a ton by working on the group project and come away with highly applicable skills. Kernighan is a good lecturer and brings in several awesome guest speakers. If you're doing things right, it will be quite a bit of work, so go into the course knowing who you want to work with and get started early.", "This is a really great course that I think should be required for all COS certificate students. Take it with Kernighan and get to know him!", "This is an excellent course if you enjoy technical projects or would like to give it a try. If you start the project early, you can build things that are truely awesome and impactful. Unfortunately the lectures are of relatively little value: you cover many different technical topics in superficial detail. Many students (myself included) simply worked on our assignments or projects on our laptops during the lecture. I would encourage the course staff to re-think the content of the lectures to cover topics that can't simply be easily self-taught by reading the documentation or browsing Stack Overflow. Despite the disappointing lectures, this is an awesome class that I would recommend to all COS majors.", "This is the class where you build a project during the second half.  It's barely a systems class.", "Try to take this course as early as you can in your Princeton career! It'll cover a ton of material that will help you very much in your future classes and internships. However, as a senior, there isn't a whole lot to gain from it, but I still really enjoyed it and am still glad I experienced this legendary course.", "Unbelievable course, start early on the project, build something great", "Very cool class. Take it to hear from a legend every week for 3 hours. Assignments are kind of bland but really helpful to get basic knowledge of many languages.", "Very good course. Find a good group to do the project with and be invested in your project idea so you can learn a lot.

I was expected it to be similar to POL/WWS classes that I had taken in the past, and Professor Fronczak is very serious about using a historical approach. However, if you are interested in analyzing primary sources, it is a great class and Fronczak is a great teacher!", "Great class! Professor is really engaging, tests are not particularly hard, and essays are short. Interesting perspective on American history that you definitely didn't get in high school. I would recommend it!", "Great history course.", "I love this course. Professor Fronczak is a champ at story telling. My preceptor was Ronny - who was good too! But I don't recommend this as your first history class ever unless you are pretty familiar with historical writing and American history. There's a lot of content to cover!", "I would absolutely recommend this class to another state. My advice would be to read the readings thoroughly and go to lecture! Also, go to Fronczak for help- he really is good at clarifying confusing concepts.", "I would take this class again. Go to lecture and keep a timeline of all the deets.", "If you are interested in present day diplomacy or interested in US history from an international perspective, definitely take this course. Take a precept with Ronny Regev.", "If you attend the lectures and do some or most of the readings, you will do fine in this class. It is definitely an easy class to take for a HA requirement, but as someone who is considering being a history major it felt a bit like a waste of my time because it was such a survey course.", "It wasn't as good as I thought it would be - readings were pretty dry. Relatively low commitment but still learnt lots", "It's ok. I was underwhelmed, but it has pretty light workload and some interesting points. Having a US history background can be helpful but not necessary.", "Keep up with the readings and attend lectures.", "Lectures are very important to attend.", "Loved this course. Absolutely take it.", "Pay attention in class, take good notes, and engage well in precepts.", "Professor Fronczak is an amazing lecturer--I'm so glad I took this course! A lot of reading, but the reading actually works with the lectures so it often feels worthwhile. This was definitely one of my favorite classes at Princeton so far.", "Professor Fronczak is one of the best lecturers at Princeton (and that is saying a lot).  He is funny, engaging, insightful, and precise in his delivery.  Furthermore, you will learn so much from the readings, which are mostly primary documents.  If you put in the effort, you will learn so much.  The history of our country's foreign relations is much more complicated than you might believe.", "Professor Fronczak is the best lecturer that I have had at Princeton. Every single lecture was engaging and fascinating. The reading can be dry, but most of the time, the documents assigned are vital to U.S. history and very worthy of close examination", "Read all of the readings. Take careful notes. Read the readings again. Take an active part in class discussions.", "Really great quality course!  Prof. presented the information so well and in a manner that would help the listener stay engaged.  There were clear connections between themes and topics so that was very helpful.  I definitely learned a lot from his lectures which were clear and easy to follow!  TAKE THIS COURSE. YOU LEARN SO MUCH.", "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the best class I've ever taken and made me completely reevaluate history. Extremely worthwhile. Why are you still even reading this? TAKE IT.", "Take it if you like reading about history. I considered myself a history person but upon going through weekly readings i sometimes wondered why I took this course because I didn't find them particularly interesting except for a few. Lectures are chill and its not necessary to attend all the time, just get notes from a friend if you miss and idk about other preceptors but Prof. Fronczak was a great one", "Take it! Even if auditing, you won't regret going to lecture, they're all so interesting, and you're not bound to the readings like other courses.", "Take it! It is fair, and very interesting.", "Take it! You'll learn a lot and look at US history from a different perspective. Ronny is a great preceptor.", "Take the class! It's interesting, you'll learn a lot, and grading is very fair.", "Take this class if you're interested in learning more than just US history but rather how the US interacts with everyone else.", "Take this class!! JMF is an amazing lecturer!! you'll learn new things even if you've taken APUSH and were really good at it. you'll look at things in a new way, and the papers/exams are not too bad. i didn't think the expectations were that different from a high school history class, so even though it's a 300 level course, don't fret it", "Take this class. Professor Fronczak is an amazing lecturer and will make you love what he's teaching. There are a lot of readings, but they're generally really interesting and are all contributing to the course in a significant way. Definitely go to all the lectures, they are the most valuable thing you'll get out of this class.", "Take this course if you want a comprehensive overview of the history of U.S. Foreign Relations. Keep in mind that it is a history course, not WWS, so there is less attention paid to evaluating policy paradigms or major international events that did not directly influence the United States. In all, it is still an instructive course for anyone interested in the field or who have previously heard good things about Professor Fronczak - he is extremely engaging as a professor and lecturer!", "Take this course!", "Take this course! It is challenging but you will learn a lot and will come away with a better, more nuanced perspective of the role of the U.S. in global politics. Ronny is a great preceptor - she provides detailed feedback on papers, and makes precept an engaging time. Fronczak is a really nice guy and his lectures are great (he likes to insert puns as well).", "This class was amazing. Fronczak was an incredible lecturer and the subject was really engaging. It was like he was telling a story every lecture. Definitely take", "This course was an excellent choice as a prospective WWS major. As an international student, I learned so much about American history, while also learning about U.S. foreign policy. There are more readings than I was able to complete each week, but I felt like attending all lectures allowed me to get a lot out of the class nonetheless.", "Very solid course.", "Would recommend if you would enjoy reading many primary source documents in their original context. Preceptors could have been more engaging but a great survey course of U.S history and a good introduction to the history department.", "You have to go to lecture, but the lectures are awesome.  Super PDFable if that's what you're looking for.", "You should take this course if you like US history -- it looks at the same history you know in a different way. It's not the easiest history course, but it's also not hard, and Fronczak is an amazing lecturer", "if you've taken apush, you won't learn that much that is new, but you'll also be in much better shape for exams.

There is no way to cram the material in the night before or skim; doing the readings in full, highlighting, and making little summary notes, are the only way to stay on top of things and really engage critically with each source. This will also help you participate in precept and give you talking points. Additionally, I would start in the weeks coming up to the midterm and final, making flashcards or a comprehensive study guide.

If you have, it's not going to be too different from high school history.", "One of my favorite classes at Princeton. I learned so much--Kruse is an amazing lecturer, and if Ray is precepting again, he's awesome. It was an awesome class. Only qualm is that I wished there were less lectures from preceptors in the second half and more from Kruse. The readings were also interesting (heavily primary-source based) and not too taxing. I'd never really been interested in learning more about American history until I took this class.", "One of the best courses I've taken at Princeton.

The readings are essentially regurgitated more in depth in the lectures, but even then it's still worth going. I missed one lecture and actually still regret it.

If you were to only take one course at Princeton, it would have to be this one. Lectures with Kruse are amazing - the one on Jim Crow is especially moving - he is the best lecturer I have had in 4 years at Princeton.

Kevin Kruse is a great lecturer but he reads from his slides so that can be a bit awkward.", "This class is a great look at American History, but it is pretty difficult if you haven't learned about the material before. For a lot of it, Professor Kruse expects you to know at least the basics of what he's lecturing about, but your preceptors can help when you're lost.", "This class is amazing! Kevin Kruse has to be one of the best lecturers at Princeton, as he turns everything into a hypnotizing story that you simply need to hear more of. Combined with his daily doses of music at the beginning and end of class and a relatively easy Dean's Date assignment, it's a great distribution req and even if you don't need it, it's a very enlightening course, as it made me look at current events a lot differently. If you get Hamilton as your preceptor, be prepared to work hard for a good precept grade as she expects tons of participation and at least one week where you prepare the class notes based on the readings.", "This course is Really well done. The Lectures were so interesting and fun due to Professor Kruse's broad knowledge and dramatic flair. The readings tended to be interesting but I feel behind by mid semester (benefits of PDFing).

The information is laid out very nicely and is clear to understand.", "This is an amazing class! One of the best lecturers at Princeton. I was hesitant because I felt like i had learned so much American history already but the way the facts are taught around the greater themes in this course make it unique and valuable experience. It truly is a study of the history of America as it has led us to where we are today. Beware of the essays on the exams, talk to your preceptors about their expectations beforehand.

I remember proofs from Euclid's Geometry, which actually comes in handy sometimes.  I know stories from the Bible now, which let's be real, is super helpful for living in America.  I know how much the plague in Athens sucked, which doesn't really help me in life, but I read about it in at least six different pieces, so it's gotta be important somehow, right?  Anyway, I learned things, but those things were not necessarily how to write a textual analysis essay, because I never fully grasped that, or how to glean the important parts of a text, because let's be real, I didn't.  Take this course if you like Classics, ancient history, language, humanity, logic, philosophy, literature, dying, or not having a life.  Or don't take it, and listen to all the kids who do take Hum whine about their lives, and laugh.

I personally want to major in the humanities and found these types of readings fascinating, but even so, I was one of the people that it just didn't work for. The course flies through tons of material in a short amount of time, so if you prefer to depth over breadth, I would reconsider. Also, even though it counts for two classes, 200-400 pages a week does not sound nearly as grueling as it really is, so be prepared and willing to dedicate a lot of time to the class. All this being said, many people have an amazing time in the course and find it incredibly rewarding, so give it a chance if you think you might like it.", "Only take this course if you really love this material.

The course provides a great scope of works, and I do feel like I have a good foundation because of it, but the pace of the class means skimming the surface of the works without exploring them at a deeper level. The writing assignments are based on close readings of passages which I found painful to write, and since there are 5 a semester it didn't feel worth it to me. Don't let the workload deter you from taking this course, there are a lot of readings but it's manageable, but do consider how interesting you find the material before taking this class.

But if you can't read it all (we feel you on Lucretius), at least skim it, and write down questions/reactions you have to the text. They don't have to be dignified or anything, my comments on Lucretius were so sassy I'm almost embarrassed to read them again. But you'll be interacting with the text, and so you'll be able to contribute in precepts.\nIt's not just about the contribution, though. Everyone in HUM has something influential or cool or insightful to say. Often it's more enjoyable to simply listen and understand what they have to say. But with a good professor (as will be the case in HUM), you can work together with your peers to draw deeper meanings from the text and get closer to the truth, which is one of the most rewarding aspects of the course. Also, you'll probably form study groups for the final this way, which is very beneficial. :p\nAs for the final, the papers prepare you for the commentary portion. For the quotes portion, honestly rereading through the texts was much better than Sparknotes. Go back through your lecture/precept notes to see which passages the professor emphasized. Look back through sections that struck you and that you commented on/highlighted. Get together with other HUMies to see what they thought key parts were, to precisely determine the style and idiosyncracies of the authors, and quiz each other beforehand. The final is ultimately a chance to show just how much you've learned in the course. It's pretty incredible to see. So to all the future HUMies, congrats. You're going to learn and do amazing things.

PHY105 is a fantastic course whereas PHY 103 is an abysmal, patronizing mess. I entered 105 having already taken mechanics at the AP level in high school (although there were kids in the class who did not have such a strong physics background) and yet I still learned a TON of new material (tensors, thermodynamics, special relatively, etc). Lyman Page, the head professor, is an incredible lecturer and has a passion for the course material that is so deep that it is all but contagious. Additionally, I strongly recommend Professor Pufu for precept (if available), as he did an amazing job at presenting the precept material in a clear manner and reinforcing material from the main class with Page (note: this 105 does not have full sized \"lectures\" due to the smaller class size, which is really awesome). Also, Pufu's Sunday office hours were a godsend whenever I was stuck on a pset problem. If there is one downside to 105, it would have to be the labs (tedious and poorly run), but they are combined with 103 so you are getting them either way.

The concepts are intuitive and fascinating, and the readings are mostly straightforward and interesting. You can definitely get by with skimming historical case studies. The exam was very fair, and the only real danger is a 15-page research paper on a war of your choice. All in all, there's not much of a reason not to take this class.

Most importantly, though, READ the New York Times!! It definitely left me with a new habit that is good for the mind and soul.", "You should absolutely take this course! Prof. Bass is a great professor and totally changed my intended major.\n\nThe readings are not overwhelming and he covers mostly everything important in class. There is only one real essay and it's not due until after fall break rather than before during midterms.

And you will schedule meetings for going thru your presentation when the precept presentation is already done.", "Definitely take this class!

Besides that I would recommend this course to anyone who needs a distribution requirement.", "Social psychology is an interesting course. It wasn't very challenging.", "Social psychology is so great to study because it's interesting and relevant to everyone's lives. The midterm content is almost entirely covered in lecture, and Prof Shelton is great, so go and take notes. You can get away with doing barely any of the precept readings.", "Super chill class! If you are taking it for a grade, go to lecture and pay attention to the studies she talks about. It's an easy A if you just take good notes and memorize them really well.

Interesting lectures and she posts outlines of the lectures afterwards which is super useful to go off of when studying for midterm or final. Weekly precept reading posts were easy and so was the CBLI project, because once we got into CBLI, we stopped having to do weekly posts and just focused on the project.

Its honestly a great class.", "The class is deceptively challenging--while the lectures essentially repeat the textbook verbatim, the exams find a way to test the most trivial detail--including obscure lines from precept readings and even numbers that are \"stressed\" in lecture. If you decide to take this class for a grade, go to the lectures and study for the exam; if you take it too lightly at first, you will be unhappy with your midterm grade.", "The lectures are fairly engaging, but be warned that the slides are not posted after lecture and the lecture outlines posted on blackboard are very incomplete. A large portion of the information is given out verbally in lecture. The midterm examination was very unexpected and difficult, and I feel that we weren't given adequate preparation for what kind of questions to expect (the sample exam items were deceivingly easy). Material discussed in precepts was somewhat inconsistent across different precepts, this may have negatively impacted precept-related questions on the exams.", "The midterm exam is so petty.  It doesn't even really test you on whether you know the concepts or not.  It's more of like can you remember every unimportant minute detail... Literally most poorly written exam I've ever taken.", "The subject matter is definitely very interesting, the precept readings, not so much. I did not like it as much as I thought I would.", "There is A LOT of work involved. The CBLI project is a huge commitment and you have to be on top of everything because the organization and communication isn't great.", "There is a lot of reading, so give yourself enough time for that. The lectures are very interesting.

Highly recommended, also isn't particularly difficult. Great for a 5th class or PDF course.", "This course requires A LOT of work, way more than I expected and should be expected of a class. I would choose any other Psychology course over this one if I had to do it again.", "This course was very interesting because of the real life examples.  The work was very manageable especially because the lectures covered everything that we needed to know from the reading.", "This is a great PSY class.

This course not only is organized poorly, but has a professor that openly isn't concerned with the quality of his course. Here are a variety of reasons that this course should undergo significant revision before it is taught again.\n\n1) Professor Carmona is not engaged with the course whatsoever. During the course of the semester, the logistics and details regarding the final exam were not disclosed until reading period, despite frequent requests and emails by myself and my fellow students. During the two midterm exams, I exited the room to ask Professor Carmona to clarify a certain problem. His response both times: \"The question is clear enough.\" I know that several of my friends had the same confusion, but received the same response from the professor. The day after the midterms, we discussed the exams in the class, and both times students raised concerns regarding the clarity of the exams. Despite these issues being vocalized, confusion remained the theme of the semester.\n\n2) If we had any questions regarding any aspect of the course, we had no outlets to get these questions answered. Professor Carmona was unresponsive to emails, and because Junwei was the only person operating the course Piazza, we were unable to get answers to logistical questions. Junwei was a massive help to the course but he could not answer every single question. In fact, many of the responses to the questions on Piazza were \"Ask Prof Carmona,\" but Professor Carmona was largely unreachable. \n\n3) The material in this course is interesting and relevant, but it is presented in a very mechanical way. The entire course is spent regurgitating R commands and formulas, and thus becomes a course in memorizing rather than a course in modeling. \n\nIf you are not an ORFE major and do not have to take this class, I would recommend taking ECO 312 to learn this same material in a practical setting. If you are an ORFE major, I would recommend reading Carmona's textbook as the exams are largely problems taken directly from the book.", "I mean you learn a lot of monte carlo simulations - it's pretty comparable to every upper level orfe class", "I would not advise anyone who does not have to take this course for ORFE to do so (not that anyone does to my knowledge).", "I would only recommend you take this course if you are an ORF major, or if you want to definitely go into quant research in finance.

Otherwise, especially if Carmona is teaching, I would probably not take it.  The grading was very disorganized on one of the midterms and the final \"project\" was rescheduled at the last minute, which I found very unfair to people who had studied in advance and planned ahead.", "It's not that bad, not that interesting either.  You won't die in the class, it's not that much work, and it's not horribly difficult, but it's not terribly fun either.", "Only take it if you have to (ORFE major). It's interesting material and not too difficult, but dealing with Carmona is annoying. His lectures are not bad, but he doesn't take feedback and has unrealistic expectations about how fast students can learn.", "Only take this course if it is required. Carmona is a very good teacher if you pay attention and take notes, and the problems sets are quite fair. The exams were very harsh. This was one of the better ORFE courses", "Recommend it --> very practical", "Since there is a lot of work involved, I would not suggest taking it unless you are truly interested in the subject, and unless you actually have to.", "Steer clear of this course unless you have to take it for ORFE. If you are not in ORFE, please do not waste your time in this class. It's awful and not relevant to anything. I honestly don't really know what we learned in this class. If you are one of the people who has to take this course, be prepared to be confused in lecture/precept and to teach everything to yourself from a very dense textbook.", "Take it if you have to, otherwise there are other courses you will probably enjoy more.", "Take it, ORFE requirement", "This course provides a good coverage of various statistical techniques like fitting distributions to data, joint distributions of random variables, various regression techniques as well as time series.

At the end, you get a really nice integrated view of biological principles.", "Take this course! Profesors are super kind and the lectures are really interesting.

The assignments were poorly designed and the support from the professor was basically non existent. \nThe assignments were not well designed either. The fourth assignment in particular was so poorly organized. There were dependencies required for running the code given to us and it was not made clear at all. Students had to try and figure out what was wrong with the given code and debug it ourselves. This is ridiculous. To give an analogy, it's like having a math class where the problems they give you state: \"2 2=5\" and you have to figure out why it does not work. The majority of the students I spoke to had no idea what we were supposed to be implementing and there was no support from the lecturer or even any attempts made by Syzmon to clear up assignment questions. The support from Piazza was laughable at best. Almost all the responses from the TA's can be summarized in one sentence, \"I'm not sure, you should ask the professor.\" I can honestly say I and many of my peers that I spoke to took away nothing from the assignments and I am very disappointed with them.\n\nIn addition to this, the third assignment was released 3 weeks after it was actually due. This led to use having to complete assignment 3 and 4 in the span of 1 week. When asked about assignment 3 on Piazza, the supposed means of communication with the professor, the professor just never responded. Overall a horrible experience.\nAttempts to reach the professor by email were never returned.

Psets-sometimes too long and have some busy work, but graded nicely and have lots of interesting questions. (Alternatively, you could let yourself not care too much.) Exams-you'll have to memorize some equations; also, every single lecture activity, including one that some people spent ~10 minutes on while you were getting a snack, can be on the exam (darn meteorites! lol). However. The final went much better (and was much fairer, imo) than the midterm, so I'm thinking you guys will have better luck on the midterm next year.

The textbook questions are the hardest questions there but can be completed simply by reading the chapter. The 2-4 other questions however is what sets this course apart. They are much more complicated and often take at least double the time the 40 textbook questions take. They require you to build upon the basics you learn in the textbook and create methods of solving the problems yourself. This stimulates a student to understand the material to a much more fundamental level and will make them truly problem-solve, rather than just applying what they read in the textbook. They will however take many hours and often make you want to rip out your hair and cry out in frustration.\n\nIn short, this course will give you more than MAT201 and will push you to your limits but will also take a huge chunk of your time.

There is a fair bit of plotting, manipulating, and analyzing spectra, for instance. This course confirmed for me that I did not enjoy observational astronomy (which itself is a valuable lesson, especially if you are a sophomore who is considering JP possibilities!), while I heard some other sophomore friends say \"this stuff is cool\", so I'm sure it did not unfairly kill anyone's love of observational astronomy, but rather gave a realistic idea of how interesting / boring it is. \n\nThat being said, this can be a frustrating course at times, because a significant portion of this course involves coding in Python, but we never learn anything but complete basics, and are thrown into the water for the rest. The lectures focus entirely on the concepts of the astronomy topics, with the equations thrown in, but the profs don't go through worked-out examples in lecture the way physics lecturers do, which might have helped. My friend who didn't know python coming in managed to pick up the skills, but basically anyone who had not done a JP / thesis was fairly out of his/her depth at various points. \n\nOur class had to write mock JWST proposals for the first time, which I thought was cool, but I think we could have had more guidance on that as well. Partly because there were no templates for JWST-specific proposals, and partly because the class proposal expectations were different, the example proposals didn't help either, and it was confusing at times the level of sophistication expected from the technical calculations, but hopefully things will be better for future classes since our proposals will be available as examples.", "If you want an idea of what astronomy research is like, this is the class.

The best way to deal with this is to get a study group together and work on problem sets as early as you can, and to ask the professors questions. Otherwise, the problem sets are nearly impossible to do on your own. \n\nSecondly, you'll learn a lot of information that you won't need for problem sets, exams (there are none) or anything, so it's really tempting to forget that information. The point of this course is to become a practical, well-informed astronomer, so forgetting all of this information defeats the purpose of the course. \n\nThe final JWST project was an attempt by the professors to be fun and relevant, but it just made everyone unnecessarily stressed because we felt so unprepared, and no one really got that much out of it.

The TA's never had anything prepared for instructional material. Interesting and engaging assignments become exercises in tedium due to the lack of a Piazza or access to helpful office hours. The final assignment is the worst assignment. It takes about 3-4 times as long as a normal Dean's date assignment. You can expect minimal to no help, arbitrary grading (no feedback, no rubric, you can't even find out why you lost points if you ask). The class expects you to replicate a publication, but it does not give you the toolset you need to complete the assignment and does not provide any instructional support for the assignment.

It's much more relaxed and there's a lot more individual attention in this class than in something like ORF 245.  Frederik is hilarious and very good at explaining things, and the TA, Ben, is really helpful with the problem sets.  It definitely helps to have some math and programming background (roughly at the level of COS 126 and Math 201/202) and I was surprised to find that a basic knowledge of probability from PHY 208 and 301 also went a long way in helping me follow along, especially at the beginning.", "It's mostly GEO-related upperclassmen and some grad students.

It was not particularly well organized or structured, and it covered surprisingly little material outside of a typical linear algebra course.The workload is pretty light, but I actually wish there would have been a bit more work to really delve into data analysis and modeling. Nevertheless, Frederik is a very engaging lecturer and the course gives a decent introduction to regression and spectral analysis (especially if you're new to modeling).", "The course is interesting and worthwhile, but if you don't have a lot of experiencing programming, especially in MATLAB, the problem sets can be pretty time consuming.", "This class gives an excellent exposure to a number of techniques used in data analysis and modeling.  It moves through a lot of material fast, but emphasized the application of these techniques and gives you time and flexibility to work through and process the problem sets. The problem sets are also excellent and you will get a lot of practice with Matlab (I learned to use Matlab in the course). Frederik is primarily motivated by helping everyone really get the material and he is willing to help you at whatever level you are coming into the class. That said, I HIGHLY recommend reviewing and feeling solid with the concepts of matrix algebra and basic statistics and probability going into the course.

Professor Raz is sometimes a bit difficult to understand in lecture, but he's always willing to help or talk about the material outside of class.  And Nikunj is a great preceptor - get him if he's still precepting this class!  The material is really fascinating stuff - it starts with discrete math topics and then moves into graph theory, and finally into theoretical computer science topics.

That being said, it made me think more critically about movies in general, so I liked that. My preceptor, Kira, is a very very very sweet person. That being said, she was not a good preceptor.

Still, the lectures were pretty unimpressive and the precepts an absolute waste of time.", "Relatively easy, but way less interesting than you think it'll be.

Easy homework to just watch movies.", "TAKE IT! I absolutely loved this class! It's great if you love watching movies and want to to see them from a more academic perspective. Aside from her crazy puns, Professor Fuss comes up with some pretty interesting ideas in lecture.

Made me watch movies in new ways.", "The movies are good to watch, the topics are straightforward, and the workload is light.", "The movies are good, but her lectures are so, so bad.

Took a lot of energy to convince myself to go to lecture everyday. That being said, it is pretty easy, and all your friends will take it, so take it.", "This course is great and a light workload. Don't stress about readings. Try to watch the movies and attend lecture, but overall your grade depends on your papers and the final. Talk to your preceptor about your argument on your papers beforehand, they will often give you great evidence or warn you against weak arguments. Plus they are grading you so it helps to be on the same page.", "This course is really fun and almost no work, but I'm an English major and I don't expect to get an A in this class. Everyone I talked to did poorly on the first paper, but if you need an LA with almost no work, this is the way to go. Everyone should watch these films at some point. Don't take it if you don't like hearing weird theories/opinions on films stated as facts. There is little room for your own interpretation/argument with the interpretations given, as far as this course is concerned.", "This is a great course. Please don't take this course because you're looking for something that you think will be easy. Yes, it is an easy class to pass, but it certainly isn't easy to write good essays. Instead, take this course because you love film. Having a couple of favorite movies isn't enough (like the 6 people in my precept who only wanted to talk about Mean Girls). You really need to be open to accept film as a form of literature/art. Many people in the course can't do this, and they spend most of their time during lecture scoffing at Professor Fuss's excellent analysis because they think she's reading too far into these movies. Do everything you can to watch all of the movies before precept. They are all excellent and worth your time. Also, don't skip the reading. It's very short and helpful. If you love movies, this is the best class at Princeton for you.", "This is great course, take it!", "This is not an \"easy\" class in terms of workload or materials - you will have to write papers and take exams which require a serious analysis of film.

The second half of the semester was really interesting.", "Watch all the movies.", "Watch as many of the movies as you can! Some people only watched half of them and I think it really takes away from the overarching themes of the course. \n\nAlso, take the time OVER THE WEEKEND and watch both--don't try to do it during the week, unless your schedule is really free on certain days.  It's much harder to find two 2-3 hour chunks of time during the week than it is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.", "Watch the films before precept.", "Watch the films.", "Watch the movies before lecture and pay close attention to them.

The latter part is true--your reading is just watching good movies, and that's fun. But as long as Prof. Fuss is lecturing, you might want to think again about taking this course because she sucks. Sucks sucks sucks. All the lectures were about the same things (the holy trinity of raceclassgender) and she speaks like a 12 year old. Lectures were supremely boring and useless for any and all writing you'll do.

I highly recommend - you have to keep up with the material, but it's a wonderful class.", "I think is a critical course in developing students programming problem solving skills. \n\nWe are forced to learn how to step back from complicated problems, relax the constraints, abstract the procedures, and discover the cleanest approach. We learn how to write much better code as a result.\n\nMany COS326 reviews only talk about recursion and proofs. They leave out the fact that COS326 also covers parallel programming and the fundamental ideas behind it (e.g. Map-Reduce). If you are unsure of the practicality of this class, then consider this another important reason for why you should learn what COS326 has to offer.", "I took this class because everyone always said that functional programming was something that you had to do as a programmer.  They said that it would improve my recursive reasoning.  But I'm almost to the end of the class with one more assignment to go and I don't know if I feel like I'm better at coding.  This leads me to the following conclusion: I spent a lot of time studying and working on these assignments for little payoff.  Now, this might be because I'm measuring my improvement in terms of my imperative language coding skills, and that's a fair criticism of my criticism.  I'm probably decent at functional language programming now.\n\nIf you're considering this class because you think that somehow this class will make you better as a programmer somehow, it's not going to make you good enough to justify all the hours.  Probably better to just spend time on LeetCode or something.  However, there's one bright spot to this class: it also functions as an introduction to PL theory and PL proofs.  I found that kind of interesting.  \n\nBasically, take this class only if you have a strong reason to, since it is a lot of work.  Also I wish this class taught Haskell instead of Ocaml since the former is more widely used.  But it's not that big of a deal since functional languages are pretty similar to each other anyway.", "If you are looking to fulfill an applications departmental for COS, look no further than this course. I think this should be essential for all COS majors. Functional programming is incredibly interesting and exposes you to a new way of programming (and even thinking about programs) that you have not been exposed to before with just imperative programming. Professor Walker is a great professor and explains things very clearly. The problem sets are also well-done and help contribute to your understanding of the material, although they can sometimes be quite long, so start them early. However, you can probably skip the precepts; they were not very helpful for me and your time would be best spent reviewing the lecture/precept materials on your own.", "It's a different way of thinking and you'll probably find it strange at first, but you learn a lot! While OCaml might not seem \"useful\" outside of places like Jane Street, the class helps you understand programming languages and the design and reasoning behind them. Assignments are not that bad - the first half is mainly fill in the function exercises (be warned, they might take quite some thinking) and/or proofs while the second half is longer but not necessarily more difficult.", "It's a good course and mostly well-organized. If you like recursion and/or proofs, you'll probably enjoy it. Chris Moretti is amazing if you can get him as a preceptor.", "It's a solid course. People say it's very math-intensive but I don't think that's as true as others say. If you math skills aren't strong then it shouldn't deter you from taking the class. A lot of time will be spent learning the conventions of OCaml though, rather than why functional programming as a discipline is interesting.", "It's cool stuff, but it's so hard! I didn't expect this course to be so difficult, as I've taken a lot of other courses. But I feel so much cooler now that I know OCaml.", "It's hard for a sophomore taking 217 at the same time, but it's definitely a great class and I think it's worth it.", "Make sure you have enough time for this class.

However these lectures and precepts were often boring and slow, and could be hard to follow. Some assignments are extremely long. I would recommend going to office hours, reviewing slides after each lecture, and doing the exercises to practice for the assignments.", "Overall, I am really glad I took this class because I have learned a lot. As a COS major, functional programming opened my eyes to a different way of thinking, that's recursive and fundamentally different from the traditional Object Oriented Programming that I was used to. Walker is a great lecturer and Moretti is super helpful. I would recommend anyone who's interested in exploring a new way of thinking as a programmer and also a more theoretical approach to programming.", "Pretty good.\nIf you are into MAT-COS then I recommend it.

So much simpler than imperative programming! I want to learn more! Nice introduction to parallel programming as well.", "Really interesting class, turns programming paradigm on its head.

It teaches a more mathematical philosophy of computer science, instead of an engineering philosophy of computer science like in 217, and this gives you a lot of perspective. Also, it is very fun if you like correctness, and has a lot of really great succinct puzzles in the assignments.", "Take this course if you're interested in a new way of thinking about programming. Not required, but would recommend also taking 217 before it as a solid computer background will really help you out here.", "The assignments can be tricky, especially as you're getting used to how FP works. Give yourself plenty of time to complete them. Prof. Walker's lecture slides are also crazy helpful for learning & for reviewing. Prof. Walker and Chris Morretti are great at explaining things in office hours, so do not be afraid to go talk to them! I can't speak for other preceptors.", "The class is well taught and well organized (at least with Walker), but know that the assignments are quite involved (think 226/217 and possibly more). The class is one of the most conceptually difficult COS classes I've taken, especially if you have a more limited COS/math background. There are proofs in the class, but most of them were manageable for non-math majors. It did teach me to think about programming in a different way which was cool, but think carefully about whether that's a worthwhile tradeoff for you.", "This class forces you to code with a lot of limitations in order to make your code easier to reason/write proofs about. Instead of loops you write recursive functions, or even just calls to map/reduce, instead of mutating data structures you create new ones. As a more practical programmer (does this do good?) I found these limitations to be frustrating.", "This course is not for everyone, but if you like abstract mathematics and elegance, and/or want to discover something completely different from all other languages you've likely learnt, take it.

Thankfully, we're finally learning a little bit of InDesign with this magazine but she literally gave us a three minute tutorial and we're all learning on our own how to use the software. Also, she is totally winging this assignment- all of us were assigned to teams where we had to delegate all of our tasks.

But Leth did ultimately walk away with a richer understanding of self, and 5 new pieces of art that were completely different from each other and the original.

In getting a better understanding of these concepts, I felt that I gained a lot.", "This is a great course to take if you are interested in Asian American History.", "This is a really great course with a reasonable amount of work.

Be careful about a quiz that happens around thanksgiving though, as it's an actual math-type quiz thats worth 10%.  Other than that, so long as you make sure to do the readings and try your hardest, you'll have the opportunity to do well in the class overall.  In other words, make sure you try throughout the semester.", "The key to succeeding in the Problem Sets, I feel, is going to McGraw and collaborating with other students. Check with one another and if you don't know what you're doing wrong, ASK. In lectures, SPEAK UP! It's important to slow the lecturer down if he/she is going to quickly, and no one will mind at all (because half the class is not paying attention and the lecturer is always so nice). I would absolutely take this course - one final piece of advice, though: DO YOUR SOCRATIC SWIRLS ON TIME.

Do not take it if you are a freshman, unless you have extensive statistics background.

Highly recommend it if you plan to do research in the future.", "This is a very well organized and well taught class about a very interesting and useful subject. I struggled quite a bit with it, but at the end, I felt like I had learned a lot. If you need to take a statistics class, this is the one you should go with. Don't even try WWS200 unless you have to - trust me. Also, don't be scared about learning R. I had zero coding experience, but I caught on pretty easily and there are always resources to help you out.", "This is class is time-consuming and difficult. However, it is definitely worth it. Get a head start on the PSETS!", "This is definitely one of the better statistics courses at Princeton. Read the book! If you don't, you will be lost at sea.
