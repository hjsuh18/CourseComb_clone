However, it's a shallow reach into a lot of topics, as you might expect from a survey. Take it as an introduction to African American culture, but don't necessarily expect the deeper analysis higher level courses offer.", "Definitely take this course. AAS majors and certificates have to take it anyway, but I would recommend it to anyone who is generally interested. Prof. Perry is phenomenal, and the reading load is super manageable.", "Definitely take this course. It's really informative.", "Do not rely too much on the precepts.", "Do not take this class with Imani Perry. She is brilliant but does not know how to lecture. The class is not structured very well and is more demanding paper wise than you would think.", "Do the readings and go to lecture!", "Do the readings. Lectures are mandatory but not helpful.", "Good intro class. Keep up with readings, and be sure to write good argument strong papers.", "Great course, overall. Perry is not the best lecturer, she reads out of the readings a lot and her voice sounds like she wants you to fall asleep. But the information is truly incredible and absolutely necessary for anyone who wants to be anyone in the United States today. Take it, take it. This class has propelled me to take a lot of other AAS classes. Oh, also, the AAS department is great.", "I would definitely take this course as soon as possible if you want to pursue an AAS certificate. This is mostly because unless you have never taken an AAS class before, you'll likely recognize most of the material from previous courses in the department. That being said, it's a good course if you want a cultural synthesis of what you have learned in AAS classes. Definitely better suited for someone who has never taken an AAS class before or first year students.", "I'm white and this course was my first formal exposure to African American studies. I learned a lot!", "If you are interested in getting a certificate or becoming a concentrator in AAS, you are required to take this course. Unfortunately, it will most likely be boring and unhelpful in terms of learning about African American Studies and Cultural Practices. The lectures are dry, and some of the preceptors are very unhelpful. If you can, have you preceptor be Heath Pearson. If you are not getting a certificate or concentrating, take any other course in the department, as they are all fantastic and illuminating. This course is not worth your time otherwise.", "If you just want to take an AAS class for general interest, do not take this class. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It will turn you off to the entire AAS department - and the other classes offered by the department are phenomenal. However, this is a required class for certificates and concentrators - TAKE THIS CLASS. The AAS department is WORTH IT, but be aware that it will be a painful experience for you - dry lectures, readings that are put up untimely, and precepts that are either hit or miss.", "If you're not planning on taking this course for the concentration or certificate, I don't think it's worth taking. If you do take it, hopefully you'll get Nyle Fort as a preceptor. He's actually in the field, unlike some of the other preceptors.", "Imani Perry is a really good lecturer, and I learned so much from taking this class. If you're interested in getting a broad understanding of the historical development and underpinnings of African American culture, definitely take this class. Also, was a great PDF for my final semester at Princeton.", "Not a bad course for those unfamiliar with subject material, lectures can be dull though", "Only take this class with Professor Glaude. Professor Perry is amazing, but she is not particularly good at lecturing.", "Somewhat boring lecture, not too hard of a class if you're interested.", "The workload was very manageable, and taking it as a 5th class would be good idea, but I also didn't get as much out of it.", "This course for me turned out to be quite a disappointment. I read about this class in Professor Glaude's \"Democracy in Black\" and was excited for it to be a rich gateway into the study of African American cultural practices. Instead it turned out to be a disorganized, inconsistent, unengaging and frustrating intro class---the only rewarding part of this class is that it satisfies an AAS certificate requirement.", "This is an easy course- not much engagement required. My least favorite so far in the department though.", "This was rough...not a heavy workload but material was too broad and disjointed. Only take if you need the certificate.", "Took with Imani Perry. Pretty easy course! Papers are not too long and very flexible to your own interests. Lecture can get a little dry but Perry will take attendance if people stop showing up. A good source for little pockets of what AAS is like but so broad.", "Would definitely not recommend to take if you're looking for an interesting AAS course. It's not as survey as you would expect. You'll learn just as much and more taking something more specific!", "find ways to stay engaged during lectures and be prepared for awful preceptor", "take this course if you're interested in culture, though come to this class well-rested as the lecturing style is bound to put you to sleep otherwise"]],
