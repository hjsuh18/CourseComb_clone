ERRORS

Multiple tabs: should there be a different way of saving/rendering pages?

QUESTIONS:
How do we update only parts of the database when periodically scraping for courses.
(I think this already happens, if courseid same, just updates the changed fields)
heroku scheduler, chronjob, 

Discussion:

HJ:
Stretch goal: Scraping periodically, keeping track of class enrollment

When you refresh page, the filters get reset, but the saved filters in profile do not get reset
Have Maximum # of courses in one department able to be black, because rn the default is 1 and this is annoying
There are grad courses between 4:30 and 7:30 e.g. FIN 501

TBA classes?

Clean Code:
Make it so that time filter is not an array of strings, but just separate boolean fileds

Clear combinations when there are no courses in the coursequeue and click on create my schedule
