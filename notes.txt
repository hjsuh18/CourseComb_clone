ERRORS

Cross listed courses search doesn't quite work e.g. ORF 363

Multiple tabs: should there be a different way of saving/rendering pages?

Calendar changes when deleting a Course combination

QUESTIONS:
How do we update only parts of the database when periodically scraping for courses.
(I think this already happens, if courseid same, just updates the changed fields)
heroku scheduler, chronjob, 

Discussion:
Should we keep the course data for previous semesters?

Search doesn't take into account the filters 

Autocomplete doesn't work for some courses: e.g. FIN 501
Seems like this is a cross-listed courses problem

Must-have courses and must have departments reset after update filter: probably because I empty it in script.html

HJ:
Stretch goal: Scraping periodically, keeping track of class enrollment

When you refresh page, the filters get reset, but the saved filters in profile do not get reset
Have Maximum # of courses in one department able to be black, because rn the default is 1 and this is annoying
There are grad courses between 4:30 and 7:30 e.g. FIN 501

TBA classes?

Clean Code:
Make it so that time filter is not an array of strings, but just separate boolean fileds
