QUESTIONS:
How do we update only parts of the database when periodically scraping for courses.
(I think this already happens, if courseid same, just updates the changed fields)
heroku scheduler, chronjob, 

Have Maximum # of courses in one department able to be blank, because rn the default is 1 and this is annoying
There are grad courses between 4:30 and 7:30 e.g. FIN 501

TBA classes?

Clean Code:

Clear combinations when there are no courses in the coursequeue and click on create my schedule
