Cross listed courses search doesn't quite work e.g. ORF 363

Multiple tabs: should there be a different way of saving/rendering pages?

Calendar changes when deleting a Course combination

QUESTIONS:

heroku scheduler, chronjob, 

Conflicts between scripts in frontend: how do we avoid this?

CDN vs Local

Discussion:
Should we keep the course data for previous semesters?

Filter: A lot of people limit the number of departmentals to 2. Have a 'maximum number of courses in one department' filter.

Search doesn't take into account the filters

Autocomplete doesn't work for some courses: e.g. FIN 501

HJ:
Filters complete
Multiple Courses
Stretch goal: Scraping periodically, keeping track of class enrollment
